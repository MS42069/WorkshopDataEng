# Softwareprojekt Stundenplan Frontend

***KNOWN BUGS***
- npm install needs "Desktop Development with C++" Workload. This can be found [here](https://visualstudio.microsoft.com/thank-you-downloading-visual-studio/?sku=Community). The solution to this problem is most likely your node version (check with `node --version`). The required node version is 16.0.2. 

## Development Setup

1. Install node for your platform.  
   A good starting point for that would be [the official node download page](https://nodejs.org/en/download).
> For building and deployment Node v16.10.0 is used. (A v16 is recommended. In our experience, v17 doesn't work, but v18 does.)
2. Install the project's dependencies.  
   You can do so by running `npm install` in the project's root directory.
3. Start the development server.  
   You can do so by running `npm run start` in the project's root directory.
> The server will automatically reload whenever code changes are made.
